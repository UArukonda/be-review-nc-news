## Setting up Environment Variables

This project requires environment variables to be set in order to run properly.

1. **Copy the `.env.example` file** to create your own environment files:

2. **Edit the copied `.env` files** (`.env.development` or `.env.test`) and replace the placeholder values with your own:

   - Set the environnmental variables (PGDATABASE) to dev or test databases respectively

3. Make sure to keep your `.env` files private. They should already be included in `.gitignore` to avoid pushing sensitive information to version control.
